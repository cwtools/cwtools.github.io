## Help with a specific game

1. Choose what [game](./projects) you want to contribute to
2. Clone the repository to a filepath, e.g. D:\Git\cwtools-ck3-config. (or copy the contents of the zip you can download)
3. Open VS Code, and go to File, Preferences, Settings
3.a. To make the changes only apply to this folder (not all folders on your computer), change the tab at the top to "workspace settings"
4. Set "cwtools.rules_version" to "manual"
5. Set "cwtools.rules_folder" to the path above. e.g. D:\Git\cwtools-ck3-config
6. Re-open VS Code. Now you are using the rules you have copied also know as cloning to your computer.
7. Open 1.30 vanilla in one window or your mod, open the rules folder in another window.
8. Add/change rules that are defined in e.g. D:\Git\cwtools-ck3-config.
9. Once you make changes to the rules, you can press "Ctrl-shift-p" and select "Reload window" to easily restart the extension.
10. Confirm errors are reduced, return to step 8.
