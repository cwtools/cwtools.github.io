# Community
There are a lot of modders in the community that use CW Tools. This a brief overview of where you can find some of them.

## Where to get help

Depending on what game you are modding, there are different ways on how to get help. The [Paradox Community]() discord is a good place to start at. For CK3, the [CK3 Mod Coop](https://discord.gg/apEvxDZ) is highly recommended. For Stellaris, try the [Stellaris Modding Den](https://discord.gg/WpeXm2h). Other modders are happy to help you if you have got a complex problem or are stuck with a specific problem and ask for help.
